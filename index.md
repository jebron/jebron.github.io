Hi there,

I'm a control system security specialist with 15 years of experience and a passion for protecting industrial control systems in critical infrastructure. By day, I defend water treatment plants, by night I love spending time with my family and playing hockey. I will be documenting various things I learn and build here along my journey. Feel free to reach out via any social platform, I'm always open to new opportunities and willing to help.
